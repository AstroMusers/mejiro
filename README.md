# mejiro

`mejiro` ("meh-JI-roe")[^1] is a pipeline to simulate space telescope images of
galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses built
on [SLSim](https://github.com/LSST-strong-lensing/slsim), [lenstronomy](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy), [pyHalo](https://github.com/dangilman/pyHalo),
and [GalSim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim).
