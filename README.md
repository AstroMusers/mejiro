# Overview

Pipeline to generate realistic simulated Roman Space Telescope WFI images of galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses
built on [`lenstronomy`](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy)
and [Pandeia](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PEN)

# TODO
* refactor: new module for `models` where lenses should live
* refactor: pandeia -> helpers
* estimated calculation time method in pandeia_input
