`mejiro` ("MEH-ji-roe")[^1] is a pipeline to simulate Roman Space Telescope Wide Field Instrument images of
galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses built
on [SLSim](https://github.com/LSST-strong-lensing/slsim), [lenstronomy](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy), [pyHalo](https://github.com/dangilman/pyHalo), [GalSim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim),
and [Pandeia](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PEN).

[^1]: "mejiro" ([メジロ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%B8%E3%83%AD) in Japanese) or "warbling
white-eye" (*Zosterops japonicus*) is a small bird native to East Asia with a distinctive white ring around the eye,
much like the shape of a strong lens.
