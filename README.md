`mejiro` ("MEH-ji-roe" or "meh-JI-roe")[^1] is a pipeline to simulate space telescope images of
galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses built
on [SLSim](https://github.com/LSST-strong-lensing/slsim), [lenstronomy](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy), [pyHalo](https://github.com/dangilman/pyHalo),
and [GalSim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim).

> [!NOTE]  
> `mejiro` will be used to generate >100k simulated Roman images of strong lenses for a **data challenge** in late 2025. Stay tuned!

# Installation

Install `mejiro` by following [these instructions in the documentation](https://mejiro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html).

# Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ["The Roman View of Strong Gravitational Lenses" (Wedig et al. 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/adc24f) was produced with `mejiro` v1.0.0. To review that version of the code, [click here](https://github.com/AstroMusers/mejiro/tree/v1.0.0).

To see how `mejiro` works, see the pipeline walkthrough notebook: `examples/pipeline_walkthrough.ipynb`.

much like the shape of a strong lens.
