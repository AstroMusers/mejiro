We include here a plausible estimate for wavefront error due to mirror polishing variations. (This is currently approximated by a map of high-frequency errors in the Hubble primary, since such data is not yet available for the Roman primary mirror.)\n",
    "  2. The exit pupil, showing the same data but with a change in coordinate system due to passing through focus. This is the pupil orientation as seen by the WFI looking outwards at the sky. \n",
    "  3. The same transmission and phase map with the addition of the phase term due to field-dependent optical aberrations and intermediate instrument optics. (Specifically, this is based on Zernike coefficients derived from the Cycle 5 optical modeling effort at GSFC.)\n",
    "  4. The final oversampled detector plane, with log-scaled intensity\n",

    "Also, a button labeled \"Download FITS image from last calculation\" will appear below the \"Calculate PSF\" button.

The first row represents the pupil plane at the primary mirror, the second row is the telescope exit pupil as seen by the instrument, and the third row is the notional pupil plane after all the field dependent aberrations have been applied to the wavefront, but before the final propagation to a detector or image plane.\n",
